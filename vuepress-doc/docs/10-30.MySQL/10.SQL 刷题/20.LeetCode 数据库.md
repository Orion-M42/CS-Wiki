### 175. 组合两个表

https://leetcode.cn/problems/combine-two-tables/

```sql
select 
	firstName, lastName, city, state
from 
	Person left join Address using(personId);

# 或者
select 
	firstName, lastName, city, state
from 
	Person left join Address on Person.personId = Address.personId;
```

### 176. 第二高的薪水

https://leetcode.cn/problems/second-highest-salary/

```sql
select (
    select 
    	distinct salary
    from 
    	Employee
    order by salary desc
    limit 1 offset 1
) as SecondHighestSalary;
```

> - select 可以没有 from 从句：没有 from 的 select 一般就是显示数据或者赋值之用
> - 用了临时表为什么就能返回 NULL？这是子查询的特质，**子查询如果在临时表中查不到数据就会返回 null**
> - limit x offset y 表示从第 y 行数据开始（y 从 0 开始计数！）取 x 个数据

### 180. 连续出现的数字

https://leetcode.cn/problems/consecutive-numbers/

```sql
select 
	distinct l1.Num as ConsecutiveNums 
from 
	Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3
where 
	l1.id = l2.id - 1 
    and l2.id = l3.id - 1
    and l1.num = l2.num
    and l2.num = l3.num;
```

### 181. 超过经理收入的员工

https://leetcode.cn/problems/employees-earning-more-than-their-managers/

```sql
select 
	e1.name as Employee
from 
	Employee e1 inner join Employee e2 on e1.managerId = e2.id
where 
	e1.salary > e2.salary;
	
# 或者
select 
    e1.name as Employee
from 
    Employee e1, Employee e2
where 
    e1.managerId = e2.id and e1.salary > e2.salary;
```

### 182. 查找重复的电子邮箱

https://leetcode.cn/problems/duplicate-emails/

```sql
select
    distinct Email
from
    Person
group by
    Email
having count(Email) > 1;
```

### 183. 从不订购的客户

https://leetcode.cn/problems/customers-who-never-order/

```sql

    name as Customers
from 
    Customers
where 
    Customers.id not in (
        select CustomerId from Orders
    );
```

### 184. 部门工资最高的员工

https://leetcode.cn/problems/department-highest-salary/

工资最高的员工不只一个，下面这种写法只能返回每个部门的工资最高的一个员工

```sql
select 
    d.name as Department, e.name as Employee, max(e.salary) as salary
from 
    Employee e inner join Department d on e.departmentId = d.id
group by e.departmentId;
```

想要返回多个，需要使用如下语句：

```sql
select 
    d.name as Department, e.name as Employee, e.salary as salary
from 
    Employee e inner join Department d on e.departmentId = d.id
where 
	# 找到每个部门工资最高的员工
    (e.departmentId, e.salary) in (
        select departmentId, max(salary)
        from Employee
        group by departmentId
    );
```

### 185. 部门工资前三高的所有员工

部门工资前三高，不代表每个部门只有三个人

```sql
select 
	d.name as Department, e.name as Employee, e.salary as Salary
from 
	Employee e inner join Department d on e.departmentId = d.id
where 
	# 找到部门工资前三高的薪资
    (select count(distinct e2.salary)
        from Employee as e2
        where e.salary < e2.salary and e.departmentId = e2.departmentId
    ) <= 2 # 同一个部门比 e.salary 高的薪资 <= 2 个，e.salary 就一定是前三高的薪资
order by d.name, e.salary desc;
```

### 196. 删除重复的电子邮箱

```sql
delete p1
from 
    Person p1 inner join Person p2 on p1.email = p2.email
where 
    p1.id > p2.id;
    
# 或者
delete p1
from 
    Person p1, Person p2
where 
    p1.email = p2.email and p1.id > p2.id;
```
